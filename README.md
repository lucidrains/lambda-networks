## Lambda Networks - Pytorch

Implementation of λ Networks, a new approach to image recognition that reaches SOTA on ImageNet. The new method utilizes λ layer, which captures interactions by transforming contexts into linear functions, termed lambdas, and applying these linear functions to each input separately.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install lambda-networks
```

## Usage

Global context

```python
import torch
from lambda_networks import LambdaLayer

layer = LambdaLayer(
    dim = 32,       # channels going in
    dim_out = 32,   # channels out
    n = 64 * 64,    # number of input pixels (64 x 64 image)
    dim_k = 16,     # key dimension
    heads = 4,      # number of heads, for multi-query
    dim_u = 1       # 'intra-depth' dimension
)

x = torch.randn(1, 32, 64, 64)
layer(x) # (1, 32, 64, 64)
```

Localized context

```python
import torch
from lambda_networks import LambdaLayer

layer = LambdaLayer(
    dim = 32,
    dim_out = 32,
    r = 23,         # the receptive field for relative positional encoding (23 x 23)
    dim_k = 16,
    heads = 4,
    dim_u = 4
)

x = torch.randn(1, 32, 64, 64)
layer(x) # (1, 32, 64, 64)
```

For fun, you can also import this as follows

```python
from lambda_networks import λLayer
```

## Todo

- [x] Lambda layers with structured context
- [ ] Document hyperparameters and put some sensible defaults
- [ ] Test it out
